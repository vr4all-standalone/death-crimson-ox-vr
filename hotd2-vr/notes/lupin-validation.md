# Lupin the Third VR validation

Original GDS-0018 only, set lupinshoo. Independent source E:\___flattovrdev\lupin-vr, branch codex/lupin-vr. Source provenance and numeric research are in lupin-findings.md. Physical headset checks remain unchecked in lupin-vr-headset-checklist.md. No game data is included.

## Engine regressions

Private copied ROMs/config/saves only. HOTD2 pass100s (camera, projection/widening), MOK pass112s (four actual shots max1px), CM menu pass72s, CM pause pass125s/23cycles/10captures. Frozen CM diffs0; yaw21.325; resumes2.783/3.988. The owned sentinel survived cleanup. No process-wide kill remains in the invoked harnesses.

## Current build and release gates

Windows development build links successfully with OpenXR. Clean optimized arm64 Quest APK builds successfully; identity com.vrlightgunhub.lupin, Lupin the Third VR, versionCode1/base1.0.0, sole Lupin setup launcher. Initial strict packaging passed with native/app commit5cd2ad1e7: APK21.60MiB, PCZIP10.20MiB, nine matching credited model files, signed VR Light Gun Hub identity. The final source refresh includes the additional lifecycle guard and recorded custom-control checks. Final build verification uses a separate clean committed checkout at E:\___flattovrdev\lupin-vr-release. It avoids changing dependency/index metadata in the development checkout. Actual native policy allow/reject, package identity/content/signer/license results and output hashes are recorded in dist/build-verification.json after successful packaging; absence of that report means those final gates are pending. Expected outputs dist/lupin-the-third-vr-quest.apk and dist/lupin-the-third-vr-pcvr.zip.

## Limits and next requested synchronization

Simulator checks do not prove physical tracking, feel, comfort, sustained frame rate, Android relaunch behavior or hardware/controller compatibility. No physical headset was installed or tested. Raw CUE/GDI boot, later stages and P2-continue visual transitions remain untested. Extreme head movement can expose black beyond geometry drawn by the original game camera. Five extra Lupin integration runs verify mixed-case custom GLB selection, actual second-launch persistence after file reordering, user-over-bundled Zapper override, per-side controller fallbacks, ±90 input clamping to ±30 with one-degree changes, and grip/stick world/gun scaling. Actual custom colored-box rendering was inspected. Physical model feel remains untested.

The user subsequently requested the final minor CM updates after both sessions finish. That work is queued separately in lupin-cm-followup.md; the initial12-row UI evidence is retained accurately until the synchronized feature set is validated.

## Additional model/control integration

Private `build-win/lupin-model-controls.run.log`: all five final cases pass (`lp-custom-select-real`, `lp-custom-persist-real`, `lp-custom-override-real`, `lp-angle-plus-real`, `lp-angle-minus-real`). Saved mixed-case selection survives insertion of an earlier-sorted GLB. User ZaPpEr overrides the bundled file. Missing sidecar uses the built-in controller; missing user side falls to the corresponding bundled side while retaining the other custom side. Gun angle clamps to ±30 and steps to ±29/back without ±31. WorldScale0.11->0.128 and HandScale0.68->0.77 via grip/stick. Private directories/settings restored and licensed model hashes unchanged.

Native standalone Release execution allows the loaded Lupin boot ID and rejects Confidential Mission through the ordinary load-error path before Event::Start/VR profile initialization. Fresh logs are required for both cases; only each launched hidden PID is stopped. Final run evidence is included in the build verification report.

## Final CM feature synchronization (2026-10-25)

The user authorized continuing while Claude only publishes the finished CM work. The comparison
covers reference e6bd81a97 through CM331063b79. The four applicable runtime changes are the
Hands row/P1 controller assignment, empty story hands, haptics Off/Light/Medium/Strong including
legacy-value migration and longer pulses, and Trigger-above-Stick labels. Lupin camera, original
hit-test lens/calibration, native shot state, movie detection, pistol/cache guards and app identity
remain the original port's measured implementation. The menu now has13 rows, top row+0.369m.

CM's GitHub/VR4ALL publishing, CM card/banner screenshots, version numbers and project-folder
rename are specific to that project. They add no Lupin runtime capability and are not copied as
Lupin publication or artwork claims. Lupin's independent setup remains intact.

The updated13-row menu first failed against the initial12-row player, then passed after the
adaptation. The focused production-function suite passes83 settings, pulse and held-state checks.
Final runtime evidence, committed source and refreshed package hashes are recorded in
`dist/cm-sync-verification.json`; its absence means the synchronization delivery gates remain
pending. All physical headset checklist items remain untested.


Independent review found an extra downward reload possible when swapping hands with a controller
already held down. A real production-block regression failed before the fix, then all83 focused
checks passed after the downward latch was transferred with its physical controller. All four
latch combinations are covered. The reviewer rechecked and closed the finding. A final-binary
runtime scenario also holds both controllers down through the swap, requiring no extra reload.
